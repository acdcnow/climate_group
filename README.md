# climate_group

thanks to @daenny for the initial version as he has no time any more I made some changes in order to get it working gain on HA core 2024.1.0

Home Assistant Climate Group

Groups multiple climate devices to a single entity. Useful if you have for instance multiple radiator thermostats in a room and want to control them all together.
Inspired/copied from light_group component [HA LIGHT](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/blob/dev/homeassistant/components/group/light.py)

## How to install:
